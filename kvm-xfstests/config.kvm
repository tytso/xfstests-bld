# The advantage of mon:stdio is that you can use Control-a followed
# by a 'b' character to send a break (magic-sysrq) character.
# The disadvantage is that in order to send a Control-a, you have to type
# C-a C-a, and an accidental "C-a c" will dump you into the qemu monitor,
# which is confusing to some users --- although a second "C-a c" will
# switch you back to the console.  If you never use magic-sysrq, you might
# want to enable the second console command, which will disable the C-a
# interception entirely.
