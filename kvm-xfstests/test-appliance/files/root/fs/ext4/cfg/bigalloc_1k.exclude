ext4/004	# dump/restore doesn't handle the bigalloc feature

# ext4/033 creates a special file system using dmhugedisk to test for
# inode overflow when online resizing.  With a bigalloc config, this takes
# too much space, so test VM will hang or abort the test run.  We
# don't need to test this for all file system configs, so just skip it here.
ext4/033

# This test tries to create 65536 directories, and with 1k blocks,
# and long names, we run out of htree depth
ext4/045

# This takes a *long* time and doesn't add much value to run on all
# configurations.  So we're going to be selective where we run it.

# This test creates too many extended attributes to fit in a 1k block
generic/454

# This test needs to know the inode size and block size for the file
# system; for bigalloc, we need to use the cluster size instead of the
# block size.
generic/204

# This test uses the block size to figure out how many files to
# create; for bigalloc, we need to use the cluster size instead of the
# block size.
generic/273

# This test creates a very small file system on a dm-thin device.
# The file system is too small for bigalloc, so skip it.  It was
# introduced to test a dm-thin bug combined with an XFS bug regression.
# If it's a problem for ext4, we'll catch it in other ext4 configs.

# These tests assume that the directory will get expanded when
# additional entries are added.  With bigalloc and with htree
# directories, this is not the case.  Since no blocks are added,
# there is no attempted block allocation and so the expected
# EDQUOT failure didn't happen.
