# The test fails due to too many block group descriptors when the

# This test uses dioread_nolock which currently isn't supported when

# This test tries to create 65536 directories, and with 1k blocks,
# and long names, we run out of htree depth

# This test creates too many inodes on when the block size is 1k
# without using special mkfs.ext4 options to change the inode size.
# This test is a bit bogus anyway, and uses a bunch of magic calculations
# where it's not clear what it was originally trying to test in the
# first place.  So let's just skip it for now.

# This test creates too many extended attributes to fit in a 1k block
