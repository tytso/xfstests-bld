# ext4/033 creates a special file system using dmhugedisk to test for
# inode overflow when online resizing.  With an ext3 config, this takes
# too much space, so test VM will hang or abort the test run.  We
# don't need to test this for all file system configs, so just skip it here.

# This takes a *long* time and doesn't add much value to run on all
# configurations.  So we're going to be selective where we run it.

# The generic/382 test fails on ext3 because the indirect blocks
# are included in the quota report, and so the resulting quota
# report output is different from what is expected in the 382.out file

# The generic/235 test fails for the same rason as generic/382 above
# after xfstests 4f4b89cdf353 which was fixing the test for 64k block
# sizes.  Unfortunately it breaks the test which use indirect blocks.
