ext4/004	# dump/restore doesn't handle the ea_inode feature

# This test creates too many inodes on when the block size is 1k
# without using special mkfs.ext4 options to change the inode size.
# This test is a bit bogus anyway, and uses a bunch of magic calculations
# where it's not clear what it was originally trying to test in the
# first place.  So let's just skip it for now.
